# Python: Crash Course 
This is how I learnt Python (baby-steps). I used the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, which was an excellent and easy-to-follow guide that helped me learn python pretty quickly.
I start with Chapter 3 as Chapter 1 & 2 were pretty basic & theoretical concepts. 
To get started I would recommend you get the book so that you can follow my python code easily as I have just practised all the material in the book. 
I have provided some comments along the way to differentiate different parts of the chapters and highlight the exercises. Detailed explanation is provided in the book for those looking to figure out the logic. Hope this helps, happy coding!
