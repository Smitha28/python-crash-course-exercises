# python-crash-course-exercises
This is how I learnt Python (baby-steps). I used the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, which was an excellent and easy-to-follow guide that helped me learn python pretty quickly.
I start with Chapter 3 as Chapter 1 & 2 were pretty basic & theoretical concepts.
